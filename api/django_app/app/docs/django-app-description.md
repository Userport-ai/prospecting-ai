*As generated by AI*

**1. Comprehensive Application Overview: Userport v2**

**1.1. Purpose and Goals**

Userport v2 is a B2B SaaS application designed to provide sales and marketing teams with tools for identifying, enriching, and managing potential customer accounts and leads. It aims to streamline the prospecting process by leveraging external data sources and AI-powered insights. The key goals include:

*   **Data Enrichment:** Augmenting basic account and lead information with data from external providers (e.g., LinkedIn, Clearbit, Apollo).
*   **Lead Generation:** Identifying potential leads based on defined Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs) and product characteristics.
*   **Lead Scoring:** Prioritizing leads based on their fit and engagement.
*   **Multi-tenancy:** Supporting multiple independent customer organizations (tenants) within a single instance of the application.
*   **Scalability and Reliability:** Designed to handle a growing number of tenants, accounts, and leads, with robust asynchronous processing.
*   **Extensibility:** Allowing for the addition of new features, enrichment sources, and integrations.

**1.2. Core Technologies and Architecture**

*   **Backend Framework:** Django (5.1.4) + Django REST Framework (DRF) 3.15.1.  This choice provides a mature, well-documented, and secure foundation for building web applications and APIs. DRF simplifies `REST`ful API development.
*   **Database:**
    *   **Primary:** PostgreSQL. Chosen for its strong relational capabilities, data integrity features, and support for JSONB data types.
    *   **Data Warehouse:** Google BigQuery.  Used for storing large volumes of raw enrichment data, enabling historical analysis and reporting.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   **Firebase Authentication:** Provides user authentication (login, registration, password management) and generates JWT (JSON Web Token) tokens for API security. This leverages a managed service, reducing development overhead and improving security.
    *   **Custom Django Authentication Backend:**  The `FirebaseAuthMiddleware` acts as a custom authentication backend within Django, bridging Firebase Authentication with Django's user model.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implemented using custom permission classes (`IsTenantAdmin`, `IsInternalAdmin`, `IsInternalCS`, `HasRole`) that check user roles against allowed roles for specific API endpoints and objects.
*   **Asynchronous Task Processing:**
    *   **External Worker Service:**  A separate service (likely running on Google Cloud Run, based on the `WorkerService` and related configurations) handles long-running tasks such as data enrichment and lead generation. This prevents blocking the main API server.
    *   **Communication:** The Django application communicates with the worker service via HTTP requests, using OIDC (OpenID Connect) tokens for authentication.
    *   **Job Queue (Inferred):**  Although not explicitly detailed, the presence of a `WorkerService` and references to `job_id` strongly suggest the use of a job queue (e.g., Celery, Google Cloud Tasks, or a similar system) within the worker service to manage and distribute tasks.
*   **API Design:** `REST`ful API following common conventions. Uses DRF's ViewSets and serializers for efficient API development and data validation.
*   **Deployment:**
    *   **Containerization:** Docker.  Facilitates consistent deployments across different environments.
    *   **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (GKE - Google Kubernetes Engine).  Provides automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
    *   **Cloud Provider:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP).  Leverages various GCP services:
        *   Cloud Run (for the worker service)
        *   Cloud SQL (for PostgreSQL)
        *   BigQuery (for data warehousing)
        *   Cloud Build (for CI/CD)
        *   Cloud Logging (for centralized logging)
        *   Workload Identity (for secure service-to-service authentication)
    * **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Deployment.yaml, backend-config.yaml, service.yaml are all examples of this.

**1.3. Design Patterns and Principles**

*   **Microservices (Partial):**  The separation of the main Django application and the worker service indicates a move towards a microservices architecture, although it's not fully implemented. This separation allows for independent scaling and development of different components.
*   **Model-View-ViewSet (MVVC):** Django's structure, combined with DRF's ViewSets, follows a variation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, promoting separation of concerns.
*   **Repository Pattern (Implied):** The use of Django's ORM and managers (like `SoftDeleteManager`) can be considered a form of the repository pattern, abstracting data access logic.
*   **Service Layer (Emerging):** The `FirebaseAuthService` and `WorkerService` classes represent a service layer, encapsulating business logic and interactions with external systems.
*   **Dependency Injection (DI - Limited):**  While not explicitly using a DI framework, the structure of `WorkerService` (taking dependencies like `base_url` and `timeout` in the constructor) allows for easier testing and configuration.
*   **Observer Pattern (Implied):**  The interaction between the Django application and the worker service, particularly with the callback mechanism, hints at an observer pattern, where the worker service notifies the Django application upon completion of tasks.
*   **Single Responsibility Principle:**  Classes and modules generally have well-defined responsibilities (e.g., `FirebaseAuthMiddleware` handles only Firebase authentication).
*   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):**  Base classes like `BaseMixin` and `TenantScopedViewSet` promote code reuse and consistency.
* **Idempotency**: The system strives to provide idempotency by storing and potentially resending the last, completed callback.

**2. Detailed Component Breakdown**

**2.1. Middleware**

*   **`TenantMiddleware`:**
    *   **Purpose:** Enforces multi-tenancy by validating the `X-Tenant-Id` header in each incoming request.
    *   **Mechanism:**
        1.  Checks if the request path is exempt from tenant verification (using `_is_path_exempt` and `_get_exempt_paths`).
        2.  Retrieves the `X-Tenant-Id` header.  Raises a `ValidationError` if missing.
        3.  Retrieves the corresponding `Tenant` object from the database.  Raises `ValidationError` if not found or `PermissionDenied` if inactive.
        4.  Adds the `Tenant` object to the `request` object (`request.tenant`).
        5.  If the user is authenticated, verifies that the user belongs to the retrieved tenant. Raises `PermissionDenied` if there's a mismatch.
    *   **Exempt Paths:**  Defines a list of paths (e.g., `/api/v2/health`, `/api/v2/auth`) that do not require tenant verification. This is important for publicly accessible endpoints.
    *   **Implications:**  This middleware is crucial for data isolation and security in a multi-tenant environment. It ensures that users can only access data belonging to their assigned tenant.
    * **Improvements:** Add cache for Tenant Objects.

*   **`FirebaseAuthMiddleware`:**
    *   **Purpose:** Authenticates API requests using Firebase Authentication tokens.
    *   **Mechanism:**
        1.  Checks if the request should skip Firebase authentication (based on the `_skip_firebase_auth` attribute or if the path is in `FIREBASE_AUTH_EXEMPT_PATHS`).
        2.  Extracts the `Authorization` header (expecting a "Bearer" token).  Returns `None` if missing or invalid format.
        3.  Calls `FirebaseAuthService.verify_and_get_user` to verify the token and retrieve/create the corresponding Django `User` object.
        4.  Updates the user's `last_login` timestamp.
        5.  Attaches the `User` object to the `request` object (`request.user`).
        6.  Returns an authentication header for failed authentication.
    *   **Implications:**  Provides a secure way to authenticate API requests, leveraging Firebase's robust authentication system.
    *  **Improvements:** Implement refresh token.

*   **`RequestLoggingMiddleware`:**
    *   **Purpose:** Logs detailed information about incoming requests, outgoing responses, and unhandled exceptions.
    *   **Mechanism:**
        *   **`process_request`:** Logs request method and path at the DEBUG level.
        *   **`process_response`:** Logs request method, path, and status code, using different log levels (INFO for 2xx, DEBUG for 3xx, WARNING for 4xx, ERROR for 5xx).
        *   **`process_exception`:** Logs unhandled exceptions at the CRITICAL level.
    *   **Implications:**  Provides valuable insights into API usage, performance, and errors, aiding in debugging and monitoring.  The different log levels allow for filtering and prioritizing log messages.
    *  **Improvements:** Add response time

**2.2. Models**

            2.  Retrieves the `Account` object (using `select_for_update` to prevent race conditions).
            3.  Checks the current `AccountEnrichmentStatus` (using `get_current_enrichment_status` and `should_process_callback`) to determine if the callback should be processed (handles idempotency and pagination).
            4.  Atomically updates the `AccountEnrichmentStatus` (using `update_enrichment_status`).
            5.  Processes the callback data based on the `enrichment_type`:
                *   `GENERATE_LEADS`:  Uses `StreamingCallbackHandler` to handle paginated lead data.
                *   `LEAD_LINKEDIN_RESEARCH`: Uses `LeadEnrichmentHandler` to process individual lead enrichment data.
                *   Other types:  Calls `_update_account_from_enrichment` to update account fields (currently handles `COMPANY_INFO` and another version of `GENERATE_LEADS`).
            6.  Returns a success response with an enrichment summary.

    *   **`StreamingCallbackHandler`:**
        *   **`handle_callback`:**
            *   Handles pagination logic.  If the callback contains pagination data and the current page is less than the total pages, it processes the leads for the current page and returns `None` (indicating that the process is not yet complete).
            *   If it's the final page, it processes the leads, updates the account status, and returns the full data.
            *   Uses `_process_leads_batch` and `_update_account_final_status`.
        *   **`_process_leads_batch`:**  Processes a batch of leads from the callback data.  Creates or updates `Lead` objects in the database.
        *   **`_create_or_update_lead`:**  Creates or updates a single `Lead` object based on the provided data.
        *   **`_update_account_final_status`:** Updates the `AccountEnrichmentStatus` to "completed" after all leads have been processed.

    *   **`LeadEnrichmentHandler`:**
        *   **`handle_lead_enrichment`:**  Processes enrichment data for a single lead (specifically from LinkedIn research).  Updates the `Lead` object with the provided data, including LinkedIn activity and personality insights.

**2.4. Services**

*   **`FirebaseAuthService`:**
    *   **`__init__`:** Initializes the Firebase Admin SDK. Tries to get existing app, and initializes new if needed. Supports initialization via service account file or Application Default Credentials.
    *   **`verify_and_get_user(id_token)`:**
        1.  Verifies a Firebase ID token.
        2.  Retrieves the user's email from the decoded token.
        3.  Gets or creates a corresponding Django `User` object.
        4.  Returns the Django `User` object.
    *   **Implications:**  Provides a clean interface for interacting with Firebase Authentication.

*   **`WorkerService`:**
    *   **`__init__`:**
        *   Sets the base URL for the worker service API.
        *   Sets a default timeout.
        *   Determines the audience URL for OIDC token verification (different for local development and Cloud Run).
        *   Initializes Google Cloud credentials (either using a local service account file or Workload Identity).
    *   **`_get_id_token()`:**  Retrieves a fresh OIDC ID token for authenticating with the worker service.
    *   **`trigger_lead_generation(payload)`:**  Sends a request to the worker service to start lead generation for a specific account.
    *   **`trigger_account_enrichment(accounts)`:**  Sends a request to the worker service to start account enrichment for a list of accounts.
    *   **`trigger_lead_enrichment(payload)`:**  Sends a request to the worker service to start lead enrichment (LinkedIn research) for a specific lead.
    * **Implications:** This service acts as a client for the worker service, abstracting the communication details and authentication.

**2.5. Data Models (Pydantic)**

* Located in `app/models/enrichment/lead_linkedin_research.py`.
* **Purpose**: Define the structure of data used in LinkedIn Enrichment and to send to the worker.
* Includes models for:
    * `LinkedInResearchInputData`: Input for the LinkedIn Research.
    *  `LinkedInActivity`: Data structure for a LinkedIn activity.
    *  `LinkedInProfile`:  Minimal lead info
    * `PersonalityTraits`: Personality traits of a lead.
    *  `RecommendedApproach`: Recommended approach for a lead.
    *  `PersonalizationSignal`: Personalized signal data.
    *  `AreaOfInterest`: Areas of interest.
    *  `EnrichmentMetadata`: Metadata.
    *  `PersonalityInsights`: Stores insights from LinkedIn data.
    *  `LinkedInEnrichmentData`:  Represents the overall structure of LinkedIn enrichment data.

**2.6.  Utils**

* **`retry_utils.py`**: Implements a `with_retry` decorator for retrying asynchronous operations with exponential backoff.
    *   **`RetryConfig`:**  A class to configure retry behavior (max attempts, base delay, max delay, exponential base, retryable exceptions).
    *   **`RetryableError`:**  A base exception class for errors that should be retried.
    *  **`RETRYABLE_STATUS_CODES`**: List of HTTP Status Codes that will trigger a retry.
* **`permission_logging.py`**:
    * **`log_permission_check`:** Decorator to log all permission checks, including successes and failures.
    * **`PermissionLoggingMixin`:** Mixin to easily add logging to permission classes.

**3. Sequence diagrams**

**1. FirebaseAuthMiddleware Sequence Diagram**

This diagram shows how `FirebaseAuthMiddleware` authenticates a request:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Django
    participant FirebaseAuthMiddleware
    participant FirebaseAuthService
    participant Firebase
    participant UserDB

    Client->>Django: API Request (with Bearer token)
    activate Django
    Django->>FirebaseAuthMiddleware: authenticate(request)
    activate FirebaseAuthMiddleware

    FirebaseAuthMiddleware->>FirebaseAuthMiddleware: Check Exempt Paths
    alt Path is Exempt
        FirebaseAuthMiddleware-->>Django: return None (skip auth)
        Django->>Django: Process request (unauthenticated)
    else Path is NOT Exempt
        FirebaseAuthMiddleware->>FirebaseAuthMiddleware: Extract Token
        alt Token Missing or Invalid
            FirebaseAuthMiddleware-->>Django: return None
        else Token Exists
            FirebaseAuthMiddleware->>FirebaseAuthService: verify_and_get_user(token)
            activate FirebaseAuthService

            FirebaseAuthService->>Firebase: verifyIdToken(token)
            activate Firebase
            Firebase-->>FirebaseAuthService: Decoded Token (or error)
            deactivate Firebase
            alt Token Verification Failed (Firebase)
                FirebaseAuthService-->>FirebaseAuthMiddleware: raise AuthenticationFailed
            else Token Verification Success
                FirebaseAuthService->>UserDB: get_or_create(email, defaults)
                activate UserDB
                UserDB-->>FirebaseAuthService: User object (existing or new)
                deactivate UserDB

                FirebaseAuthService->>UserDB: update_last_login()
                FirebaseAuthService-->>FirebaseAuthMiddleware: User object
            end
            deactivate FirebaseAuthService

            FirebaseAuthMiddleware->>Django: (User, None)
            deactivate FirebaseAuthMiddleware
        end
    end

    Django->>Django: Process request (authenticated)

    alt Exception in Middleware
        FirebaseAuthMiddleware-->>Django: raise AuthenticationFailed
    end

    deactivate Django
    Django-->>Client: API Response
```

**Key Points:**

*   **Exempt Paths:**  The middleware first checks if the requested path is exempt from Firebase authentication.  If so, it skips the authentication process.
*   **Token Extraction:** It extracts the Bearer token from the `Authorization` header.
*   **Firebase Verification:**  `FirebaseAuthService` interacts with Firebase to verify the token.
*   **User Retrieval/Creation:**  `FirebaseAuthService` gets or creates a Django `User` object corresponding to the Firebase user.
*   **Authentication Result:** The middleware returns a tuple `(user, None)` on successful authentication, or `None` if authentication is skipped or fails (before token verification).  It raises `AuthenticationFailed` if the token is invalid.

**2. TenantMiddleware Sequence Diagram**

This diagram shows how `TenantMiddleware` handles tenant validation:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Django
    participant TenantMiddleware
    participant TenantDB
    participant UserDB

    Client->>Django: API Request (with X-Tenant-Id header)
    activate Django
    Django->>TenantMiddleware: __call__(request)
    activate TenantMiddleware
    TenantMiddleware->>TenantMiddleware: _is_path_exempt(request)
    alt Path is Exempt
        TenantMiddleware-->>Django:  get_response(request)
        deactivate TenantMiddleware
        Django->>Django: Process Request
    else Path is NOT Exempt
        TenantMiddleware->>TenantMiddleware: Get X-Tenant-Id header
        alt X-Tenant-Id Missing
            TenantMiddleware-->>Django: raise ValidationError (missing header)
        else X-Tenant-Id Present
            TenantMiddleware->>TenantDB: get(id=tenant_id)
            activate TenantDB
            alt Tenant Not Found or Invalid ID Format
                TenantDB-->>TenantMiddleware: DoesNotExist or ValueError
                deactivate TenantDB
                TenantMiddleware-->>Django: raise ValidationError (tenant not found or invalid ID)
            else Tenant Found
                TenantDB-->>TenantMiddleware: Tenant object
                alt Tenant Not Active
                    TenantMiddleware-->>Django: raise PermissionDenied (tenant inactive)
                else Tenant Active
                    TenantMiddleware->>Django: request.tenant = tenant
                    alt User is Authenticated and Tenant Mismatch
                        TenantMiddleware->>UserDB: Check request.user.tenant_id == tenant.id
                        activate UserDB
                        UserDB-->>TenantMiddleware: Permission Denied (wrong tenant)
                        deactivate UserDB
                        TenantMiddleware-->>Django: raise PermissionDenied
                    else User is Unauthenticated or Tenant Match
                        UserDB-->>TenantMiddleware: OK (if checked)
                        TenantMiddleware-->>Django: get_response(request)
                    end
                end
            end
        end
    end

    Django-->>Client: API Response

    alt Exception in Middleware
        TenantMiddleware-->>Django: raise ValidationError or PermissionDenied
    end
deactivate Django
```

**Key Points:**

*   **Exempt Paths:** Checks if the path is exempt from tenant verification.
*   **Header Check:**  Retrieves the `X-Tenant-Id` header.
*   **Tenant Retrieval:**  Gets the `Tenant` object from the database.
*   **Status Check:** Verifies that the tenant is active.
*   **User-Tenant Association:** If the user is authenticated, ensures the user belongs to the specified tenant.
* **Request Modification:** Sets `request.tenant`.

**3. Account Creation and Enrichment Sequence Diagram**

This diagram illustrates the full flow of creating an account and triggering enrichment:

```mermaid

    end
    WorkerService-->>AccountsViewSet: Enrichment responses (job_ids)

      EnrichmentCallback->>EnrichmentCallback: should_process_callback()
       alt Should NOT Process Callback
         EnrichmentCallback-->>Worker: HTTP 200 (skipped)
       else Should Process Callback
         EnrichmentCallback->>AccountEnrichmentStatusDB: update_enrichment_status()
         activate AccountEnrichmentStatusDB
         AccountEnrichmentStatusDB-->>EnrichmentCallback: Updated AccountEnrichmentStatus
         deactivate AccountEnrichmentStatusDB
            alt Enrichment Type is GENERATE_LEADS
              EnrichmentCallback->>StreamingCallbackHandler: handle_callback(data)
            else alt Enrichment Type is LEAD_LINKEDIN_RESEARCH
              EnrichmentCallback->>LeadEnrichmentHandler: handle_lead_enrichment(lead_id, account_id, processed_data)

              EnrichmentCallback->>EnrichmentCallback: _update_account_from_enrichment(account, type, data)
            end
            EnrichmentCallback-->>Worker: HTTP 200 OK
        end
      deactivate EnrichmentCallback
deactivate Django
```

**Key Points:**

*   **API Request:** The client sends a request to create an account.
*   **ViewSet Handling:** The `AccountsViewSet` validates the data, creates the `Account` object, and then calls `_trigger_enrichments`.
*   **Asynchronous Trigger:** `_trigger_enrichments` uses the `WorkerService` to send asynchronous requests to the worker service.  Crucially, the Django API *does not wait* for these tasks to complete.
*   **Worker Processing (Simplified):** The worker service (running separately) processes the enrichment tasks.
*   **Callback:** The worker service sends a callback to `enrichment_callback` when an enrichment task (or a page of a task) is finished.
*   **Idempotency and Pagination:** `enrichment_callback` uses `should_process_callback` to determine if it should actually process the callback, handling pagination and avoiding duplicate processing.
*   **Status Updates:** `update_enrichment_status` atomically updates the `AccountEnrichmentStatus`.
* **Streaming/Handlers:** The appropriate handler is called based on `enrichment_type`.

       else Should Process Callback
         EnrichmentCallback->>AccountEnrichmentStatusDB: update_enrichment_status()
         activate AccountEnrichmentStatusDB
         AccountEnrichmentStatusDB-->>EnrichmentCallback: Updated AccountEnrichmentStatus
         deactivate AccountEnrichmentStatusDB

         EnrichmentCallback->>LeadEnrichmentHandler: handle_lead_enrichment(lead_id, account_id, data)

         deactivate LeadEnrichmentHandler

        EnrichmentCallback-->>Worker: HTTP 200 OK
       end
    deactivate EnrichmentCallback
deactivate Django
```

**Key Points:**

*   **Lead Retrieval:** The `LeadsViewSet` retrieves the `Lead` object.
*   **Payload Creation:** It constructs a payload, including HTML content from the request, and other input data by using Pydantic Models.
*   **Status Update:**  The lead's `enrichment_status` is updated to "in_progress" *before* sending the request to the worker.
*   **Asynchronous Trigger:** The `WorkerService` is used to send an asynchronous request.
*   **Callback Handling:** The `enrichment_callback` is used, just like in account enrichment. This is important for consistency and handling potential retries.
*   **`LeadEnrichmentHandler`:** This handler is specifically responsible for processing the LinkedIn research data and updating the `Lead` object.
* **Pydantic Usage**: The request data is constructed into a Pydantic model and serialized to send to worker service. The response is parsed into Pydantic Models and the data is updated.



**3. Deployment and Infrastructure**

*   **Dockerfile:**  Defines the Docker image for the Django application.
    *   Uses a multi-stage build to reduce image size.
    *   Installs system dependencies (including `cloud-sql-proxy`).
    *   Installs Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
    *   Copies the application code.
    *   Sets environment variables.
    *   Runs `collectstatic` (though this is currently commented out).
    *   Starts Gunicorn as the web server.
*   **Kubernetes Configuration (`k8s` directory):**
    *   **`deployment.yaml`:** Defines the Kubernetes Deployment for the Django application.
        *   Specifies the Docker image, number of replicas, resource requests and limits, environment variables, readiness and liveness probes.
        *   Uses a `serviceAccountName` (`userport-ksa`), indicating Workload Identity is used.
        *   Mounts secrets (database credentials).
    *   **`backend-config.yaml`:**  Defines a BackendConfig for the Google Cloud Load Balancer, configuring health checks.
    *   **`service.yaml`:**  Defines a Kubernetes Service (type `NodePort`) to expose the Django application.  Includes an annotation for the `BackendConfig`.
*   **Cloud Build Configuration (`cloudbuild.yaml`):**
    *   Defines a Cloud Build pipeline for building and deploying the application.
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  **Build:** Builds the Docker image using BuildKit, with caching.
        2.  **Push (latest):** Pushes the image to Google Container Registry (GCR) with the `latest` tag.
        3.  **Push (SHA):** Pushes the image to GCR with a tag based on the commit SHA.
        4.  **Get Credentials:** Retrieves Kubernetes cluster credentials.
        5.  **Setup KSA:** Annotates the Kubernetes Service Account for Workload Identity.
        6.  **Create Secrets:** Creates a Kubernetes Secret for database credentials.
        7.  **GKE Deploy:** Deploys the application to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) using the built image.
*   **Start Script (`start.sh`):**
    *   Detects if a service account file (`/secrets/service-account.json`) is present.  This determines whether to use local credentials (for development) or Workload Identity (for production).
    *   Starts the `cloud-sql-proxy` in the background, connecting to the Cloud SQL instance. The proxy provides secure access to the PostgreSQL database.
    *   Waits for the `cloud-sql-proxy` to become ready by repeatedly checking for a connection on port 5432 (up to 30 attempts with 2-second delays).
    *   Calculates the number of Gunicorn workers if `GUNICORN_WORKERS` is not set (using `2 * $(nproc) + 1`).
    *   Starts Gunicorn, binding to `0.0.0.0` on the specified port (defaulting to 8000), with the configured timeout and number of workers.  Uses the `userport.wsgi:application` module.
    * `exec` replaces the shell process with the gunicorn process.

**4. Detailed Workflow Examples**

**4.1. Account Creation and Enrichment**

1.  **User Action:** A user (with appropriate permissions) creates a new account via the `/api/v2/accounts` endpoint, providing the company name, website, and associated product ID.
2.  **API Handling:**
    *   The `TenantMiddleware` verifies the `X-Tenant-Id` header.
    *   The `FirebaseAuthMiddleware` verifies the user's Firebase token.
    *   The `AccountsViewSet.create` method handles the request:
        *   Validates the input data using the `AccountDetailsSerializer`.
        *   Creates a new `Account` object in the database.
        *   Calls `_trigger_enrichments` to initiate asynchronous enrichment tasks.
3.  **Enrichment Trigger:**
    *   `_trigger_enrichments` calls the `WorkerService` to send requests to the external worker service.  Separate requests are sent for company information enrichment and lead generation.
    *   The `WorkerService` constructs the request payload, including the account ID, website, product details, and tenant ID.  It also adds an OIDC token to the request header for authentication.
    *   The worker service (running on Cloud Run) receives the request, authenticates it (using OIDC), and enqueues the enrichment tasks.
4.  **Asynchronous Processing (Worker Service - Inferred):**
    *   The worker service (likely using a job queue like Celery or Google Cloud Tasks) processes the enrichment tasks.
    *   It interacts with external data providers (e.g., LinkedIn, Clearbit, Apollo) to retrieve company information and potential leads.
    *   It stores the raw enrichment data in BigQuery.
    * It sends intermediate updates to the `enrichment_callback` endpoint, if needed.
5.  **Enrichment Callback:**
    *   When an enrichment task is complete (or a page of results is ready), the worker service sends a callback to the `/api/v2/internal/enrichment-callback` endpoint.  This includes the `job_id`, `account_id`, `status`, `enrichment_type`, and `processed_data`.
    *   The `enrichment_callback` function:
        *   Verifies the Cloud Run token (though this is currently commented out – **CRITICAL: this should be enabled**).
        *   Retrieves the `Account` object.
        *   Gets/Creates or updates the `AccountEnrichmentStatus` record, tracking the progress and status of the enrichment.
        *   Processes the `processed_data` based on the `enrichment_type`.  For `GENERATE_LEADS`, this involves creating or updating `Lead` objects.  For `COMPANY_INFO`, this involves updating the `Account` object with the enriched data.
6.  **Result:** The account is populated with enriched data, and leads are generated (if requested).  The user can view the updated information through the API.

1.  **User Action:** A user triggers LinkedIn research enrichment for a specific lead via the `/api/v2/leads/{lead_id}/enrich_linkedin_activity` endpoint, providing the lead ID, and optionally HTML content (posts, comments, reactions).
2.  **API Handling:**
    *   The middleware components (tenant and authentication) perform their checks.
    *   The `LeadsViewSet.enrich_linkedin_activity` method handles the request:
        *   Retrieves the `Lead` object (and its related `Account` and `Product`).
        *   Validates that the lead has a LinkedIn URL.
        *   Constructs input data using Pydantic models `LinkedInResearchInputData`.
        *   Creates a payload for the worker service, including the lead ID, account ID, person's name, company name, LinkedIn URL, HTML content, job ID, user ID, and other input data.
        *   Updates the `Lead` object's `enrichment_status` to "in_progress".
        *   Calls the `WorkerService.trigger_lead_enrichment` method to send the request to the worker service.
3.  **Asynchronous Processing (Worker Service - Inferred):**
    *   The worker service receives the request, authenticates it, and enqueues the enrichment task.
    *   It likely uses a library or service that can process LinkedIn data (and potentially other sources, based on the `research_request_type` field).
    *   It stores the raw enrichment data in BigQuery.
4.  **Enrichment Callback:**
    *   When the LinkedIn research is complete, the worker service sends a callback to the `/api/v2/internal/enrichment-callback` endpoint.
    *   The `enrichment_callback` function:
        *   Verifies the token (again, this needs to be uncommented).
        *   Retrieves the `Account` object.
        *   Updates the `AccountEnrichmentStatus`.
        *   Calls `LeadEnrichmentHandler.handle_lead_enrichment` to process the data.
        *    This method uses Pydantic Models to parse the LinkedIn research data, extracts the personality insights, merges them with `lead.enrichment_data` and `lead.custom_fields`, and updates lead's `enrichment_status` to `COMPLETED`.
5.  **Result:** The `Lead` object is updated with LinkedIn activity data, personality insights, and other enriched information.
